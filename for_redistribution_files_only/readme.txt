Packaging and Deploying DecompressNConvert

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

A. If MATLAB Runtime version 9.2 (R2017a) has not been installed, install it in one of 
   these ways:

i. Run the package installer, which will also install the MATLAB Runtime.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the installer. 

ii. Download the Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2017a from:

    http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
iii. Run the MATLAB Runtime installer provided with MATLAB.

B. Verify that a Windows 64-bit version of Python 2.7, 3.4, and/or 3.5 is installed.

2. Installing the DecompressNConvert Package

A. Go to the directory that contains the file setup.py and the subdirectory 
   DecompressNConvert. If you do not have write permissions, copy all its contents to a 
   temporary location and go there.

B. Execute the command:

    python setup.py install [options]
    
If you have full administrator privileges, and install to the default location, you do 
   not need to specify any options. Otherwise, use --user to install to your home folder, 
   or --prefix="installdir" to install to "installdir". In the latter case, add 
   "installdir" to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. For details, refer to:

    https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html


3. Using the DecompressNConvert Package

The DecompressNConvert package is on your Python path. To import it into a Python script 
   or session, execute:

    import DecompressNConvert

If a namespace must be specified for the package, modify the import statement accordingly.
